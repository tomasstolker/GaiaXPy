Caveats / Known issues
======================

Plotter
-------

The output DataFrames contain metadata indicating which type of spectra they contain. This metadata can be accessed
through the attribute :python:`attrs`. The plotter tool relies on this information to know which type of plot to generate.

Pandas does not yet have a robust method of propagating metadata attached to DataFrames. As a result, if certain
operations are applied to the DataFrame, this information may be lost which will cause the plotter to fail. Luckily,
most common operations preserve metadata.

Filters
-------

Since GaiaXPy was originally published, two issues with photometric filters have been found. The affected filters are
**SDSS** and **PanSTARRS1_Std**.

**SDSS**: The SDSS filters (available as ``PhotometricSystem.SDSS``) that were originally published have been replaced with
those defined in `Doi et al. 2010, AJ, 141, 47 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AJ....139.1628D/abstract>`_.
Note that the standardised version (``PhotometricSystem.SDSS_Std``) was already based on ``Doi et al. 2010, AJ, 141, 47``
and is therefore unchanged with respect to previous versions of GaiaXPy.

**PanSTARRS1_Std**: Due to a bug in GaiaXPy, the synthetic photometry for the standardised ``PanSTARRS1 y`` band (contained
in the fields ``y_ps1_flux``, ``y_ps1_flux_error`` and ``y_ps1_mag``) has been generated without applying the flux offset
mitigating the systematic effect at the faint end due to background issues (also referred to as hockey-stick, see Section 2.2.1 and
equation 13 in `Gaia Collaboration, Montegriffo, et al., 2022 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220606215G/abstract>`_).
The offset should have been applied to the synthetic flux and then propagated to the flux error and magnitude. However,
no offset was being applied.

Both issues were **fixed in GaiaXPy version 1.2.4**.

OpenSSL / LibreSSL
------------------
In some cases, an incompatibility problem with ``OpenSSL/LibreSSL`` may arise. This is due to a problem with some versions
of the ``urllib3`` (issue first discovered in May 2023) used by the ``requests`` library which is required to connect to
the Gaia Archive.
The error message contains the sentence: ``"urllib3 v2.0 only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+"``.
The problem can be resolved by installing ``urllib3`` version ``1.26.6``:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install urllib3==1.26.6

More information `here <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/3020>`_.

Ubuntu 22.04 (plotting)
-----------------------
On ``Ubuntu 22.04 LTS`` with GaiaXPy version ``2.1.3`` onwards, some small plotting-related errors may occur
due to missing LaTeX-related system dependencies. These are not issues with GaiaXPy itself, but with the local environment.

The following error may appear when producing plots:

.. code-block:: bash

    ! LaTeX Error: File `type1ec.sty` not found.

This can be resolved by installing the ``CM-Super`` fonts:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get -y install cm-super

After this, the following error may occur:

.. code-block:: bash

    Failed to process string with tex because dvipng could not be found.

This can be fixed by installing ``dvipng``:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install dvipng

CentOS 7 (installation)
-----------------------
On systems running ``CentOS 7`` (which reached end of life in June 2024), GaiaXPy version ``2.1.3`` and later cannot
be installed.

This is due to the system compiler (``gcc 4.8``) lacking support for ``stdatomic.h``, which was introduced in ``gcc 4.9``.
As a result, building GaiaXPy fails on these systems.

Support for ``stdatomic.h`` was added in ``gcc 4.9``: `see details <https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.9/changes.html>`_.
